README
    Garland is a very simple monitoring and alerting tool for home labs.
    Garland contains of bulb series, just like real garland does. Each bulb
    can be configured to periodically check some value (Graphite metric,
    shell-scrip output, etc.). If value is out of configured range bulb goes on.
    Notification is sent to configured contacts on each on and off bulb event.

INSTALL
    As a regular Go program, you can install it with `go get` and manage
    service by yourself.
    go get github.com/vchimishuk/garland

    But the best way is to build Debian package and use systemd to manage
    garland daemon.
